# Permissions

## Location Permission

The moment you login to the application the first permission that is required is for location services. This permission
is required by the app to show the **user** location and **not the drone**. As you can see the app presents you with two
options.

1. `Precise` - Ideal conditions can pinpoint you down to a meter.
2. `Approximate` - Your location can be within 100 meters.

The user has three options to select from:

1. While using the app.
2. Only this time.
3. Don't allow.


## Media Permission

The above image is the second permission that is required by the application which is access to the photos and media. 

By granting this permission you will be able to import KML and KMZ files into the application. This will be further
explained in the coming pages. Also, you will be able to store the compressed versions of the drone camera pictures.
