# What's in the box?

## NextCC

NextCC is an indigenous Companion Computer that is an addition to a usual flight controller. It transforms your drone to a 4G enabled drone system with endless new possibilities such as BVLoS operations and live video stream from infinite distance. 

## Antennas

Antennas play a critical role in extending the range and enhancing the quality of wireless signals, leading to improved connectivity and faster data transfer speeds. In conjunction with the NextCC, antennas help to receive and transmit signals effectively.

## Cables

 - 4-pin JST connector with lock (1.25mm pitch)
 - 6-pin JST connector with lock (1.25mm pitch)
 - Power cable for NextCC

## Tamper Proof module (optional)

A tamper-proof module will prevent the drone from taking off if any tampering is detected, such as opening the top, bottom, or side plates. If tampering is detected, the drone's warranty will become void. To regain the ability to take off, the user must contact the manufacturer.

## Network Hub (optional)

An Network Hub connects multiple devices to the same network by physically connecting them to the switch using cables. Once a device is connected to a port on the switch, it manages the flow of data between the connected devices by directing incoming and outgoing data to the correct port based on the device's IP address.
